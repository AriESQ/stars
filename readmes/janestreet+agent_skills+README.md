# Agent skills from Jane Street

A collection of skills for AI agents and chatbots.
Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file
with instructions for the agent.

## Skills

- **socratic-tutor** — turns an LLM into a strict personal tutor that teaches a
  topic of your choice using the Socratic method: a diagnostic, a skill map with
  levels 0-5, one question at a time, spaced review, and a final assessment.

## How to use

With a coding agent that supports the common `SKILL.md` format, copy the skill
directory into your agent's skills folder, then ask the agent to use it
("teach me X").

With a plain chatbot, paste the body of the skill's `SKILL.md` into the chat
(or into a custom/system prompt), followed by what you want it to do.
