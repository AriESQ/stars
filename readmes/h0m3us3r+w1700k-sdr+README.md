# W1700K SDR

Turns a Gemtek W1700K Wi-Fi 7 router into a wideband software-defined receiver.
The router's MediaTek MT7996 radio captures raw 14-bit IQ at up to 320 Msps,
its Airoha AN7581 SoC streams it over 10 GbE, and a Linux host shows it as a
live spectrum and waterfall in the browser, with the receiver's controls next
to it.

![The 2.4 GHz band live: spectrum and waterfall](docs/images/live-2g4.gif)

*The whole 2.4 GHz band at 320 Msps, live, with the decimation's roll-off
corrected in the stream ("flatten"): a 262,144-point FFT of every sample, 100
spectra a second (this recording runs at 50 frames a second).*

The MT7996 runs only our own firmware: a ROM patch, WM and WA built from this
repository, with no MediaTek code. It brings the radio up from a cold power-on
by itself, from MediaTek's initialisation and calibration decoded register by
register against a trace of MediaTek's own firmware, and takes its commands
(LO, sample rate, capture, stream, gain, filter) from the host. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Sample rates | 40, 80, 160 or 320 Msps of 14-bit complex IQ on every band, independent of the LO and the filter; on band 2 also 640/2 (every other sample of 640 Msps: flat to ±155 MHz, but signals 160–320 MHz away fold in) |
| Bands | 2.4 GHz (MT7976), 5 GHz and 6 GHz (two MT7977s); switching bands is a register write inside a running stream |
| Tuning | No channels: the LO is any Hz a band's synthesizer locks at (unit A: 2.081–2.748, 4.647–7.509 and 4.707–7.576 GHz), on its grid of 2.98 Hz (2.4 GHz) or 11.9–14.3 Hz steps; retuned mid-stream (about 1 ms) |
| Front end | AGC or manual LNA/baseband gain; analog filter 20–320 MHz |
| Transport | the radio DMAs into a 1 GiB ring in SoC DRAM; the kernel sends every 8 KiB slice as one UDP datagram, zero-copy, on the 10 GbE port; at 320 Msps half the slices are packed to 28 bits per sample pair on the radio's own cores to fit the link (lossless, automatic) |
| Host | `w1700k-stream` receives the export and serves the IQ stream to every consumer on the host (shared memory, complex int16, gap-tagged), with an optional correction ("flatten") of the decimation's roll-off applied to the samples themselves; `w1700k-spectrum`: 262,144-point FFT at 100 frames/s over every sample, browser UI, live controls; `sdr-recv` records the stream |

*2.4 GHz at 320 Msps, flattened: Wi-Fi frames and shorter hopping bursts on a
floor that stays level to the band's edges. The Stream panel shows the link
carrying 9.75 Gbit/s, half of the slices packed, and every sample transformed.*

## Getting started

You need a W1700K (HW 1.x) or W1700K2 (HW 2.1), a 3.3 V USB serial adapter on
its console header, an Ethernet cable to its `lan3` port for installation, and
a 10 GbE NIC on the host cabled to its `wan` port (10GBASE-T; an X710 with a
copper SFP+ module works) for the IQ stream. Both revisions run the same images.
Most units carry a W25N04KV NAND; some W1700K2s carry a W25N04LV (ID `ef 8b 23`),
which is supported but has never been run on a unit: `init/install` stops on
one until you pass `--i-dont-care-about-nand-corruption`, and asks for a raw
dump of it (`init/rawdump`) for the maintainers.

```sh
make                                   # everything, from public sources (~10 min plus downloads)
make check                             # the test suite

sudo init/host/link up IFACE           # 192.168.1.10/24 on the NIC cabled to lan3
sudo init/host/tftp-forward enable IFACE
init/install                           # back up the NAND, install, save the radio calibration

sudo init/host/link up IFACE10G 10.77.0.10/24 9216    # the 10 GbE stream link
host/stream/build/w1700k-stream &                      # the stream, for every consumer on this host
host/spectrum/build/w1700k-spectrum --controller "host/bin/w1700k serve" --listen 0.0.0.0:8073
```

Then open `http://HOST:8073/` and press ▶. The first start loads the radio
firmware and brings the radio up (about 2 s). Without the browser, the same
operations are `host/bin/w1700k load|start|band|tune|gain|filter|stop|status`.

Build requirements: a C/C++ compiler, make, git, Python 3.10+, the usual
Buildroot prerequisites, clang, ld.lld, llvm-objcopy and llvm-readobj (RISC-V
firmware), openssl (firmware container encryption), and
`libfftw3-dev` and `zlib` for the stream service and the spectrum server. No vendor firmware is
downloaded or needed.

## Read before use

- **Our firmware is receive-only.** It runs none of MediaTek's transmit
  calibrations and keeps the MAC's transmit path disabled; a gapless watch at
  5250 MHz saw nothing during a load, where MediaTek's firmware transmits a
  full-power burst. Still, do not cable an antenna port straight into a
  sensitive instrument without an attenuator.
- **Our ROM patch writes no eFuse.** MediaTek's ROM patches since 2025
  permanently program one eFuse gate bit on their first run (also with
  MediaTek's own driver); a unit that ever ran one has that bit set.
- **Installation replaces the stock operating system.** `init/install` first
  copies the NAND's data to the host; keep that copy. `init/restore` writes it
  back and returns the unit to its stock firmware.
- Accessing undocumented MT7996 or AN7581 addresses can hang the SoC or wedge
  the radio until a power cycle. `include/hw/` marks every known hazard.
