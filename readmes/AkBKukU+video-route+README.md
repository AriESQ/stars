## Demo
![Demo](doc/demo.png)
See [config-sample.json](config-sample.json) for how this demo is implemented.

## Usage Example

You will need to create a JSON configuration file the details how to access your devices and the buttons and commands you want to be able to execute on it. For example, if you have a Retrotink 4K you will need to configure it as a serial device.

     "video_controllers":{
        "rt4k":{
            "name":"Retrotink 4K",
            "type":"serial",
            "baud":115200,
            "parity":"N",
            "serial":"FT232R USB UART - FT232R USB UART",
            "cmd_delay":0,
            "line_end":"\n"
        }

Then you can configure `sources` for it and create a group of buttons for basic functions.

    "sources":{
        "rt4k":{
            "name":"RT4K Controls",
            "sources":{
                "rt4k-power":{
                    "name":"Power",
                    "color":"#FFF",
                    "background":"#c00",
                    "rt4k":["remote pwr","pwr on"]
                    },
                "rt4k-phase":{
                    "name":"Phase",
                    "rt4k":["remote phase"]
                    },
                "rt4k-gain":{
                    "name":"Gain",
                    "rt4k":["remote gain"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }

This would look like [this exmple file](doc/examples/rt4k.json) when done and would produce a page that looks like the following:

Clicking any of the three buttons would access the video controller defined as `rt4k` and send it the commands in the list.
